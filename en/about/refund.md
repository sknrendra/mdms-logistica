<h1 style='text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2vh;'>Return and Refund Policy</h1>

1. At the beginning and end of the rental period, the Renter is required to pick up and return the vehicle at the Lessor's location. However, if the Renter encounters difficulties in picking up and returning the vehicle, the Lessor will deliver the vehicle to the Renter and collect the vehicle from the Renter's location for an additional delivery and pick-up fee. The Renter is responsible for covering this fee.
2. The Renter is subject to a Deposit/Security. The deposit amount is determined based on the price of the vehicle to be rented. The deposit will be returned 100% 14 days after the end of the rental period, provided that there are no traffic violations and vehicle damage compared to the vehicle's original condition. If a traffic violation ticket is issued during the rental period without a driver provided by the Lessor, the Renter must promptly take responsibility for the fine. If the fine is not paid, a late payment penalty of 0.1% will be charged for each day starting the day after the Renter receives the fine invoice.
3. If the payment of the maximum rental price that has been paid exceeds the amount stated in paragraph 5-4, the vehicle must be immediately returned and the deposit provided at the beginning of the rental will be forfeited.
4. If the lessee does not use the car for their own needs during the contract period, the lessee is still required to pay the full rental price of the car without reducing the rental price.
5. If the lessee is unable to fulfil their obligation to pay the rental price of the vehicle according to the invoice issued by MJI/Lessor, the lessee's obligation will be transferred to the Guarantor.
6. The Renter is exempted from any claims if the vehicle is stolen when the Renter employs a driver from the Lessor. If the stolen case is proven to be due to the Renter's mistake, the Renter must pay 100% of the new vehicle cost. All Lessor's vehicles are comprehensive insurance, if the insurance does not cover 100%, the Renter is obliged to add up to 100% of the vehicle as new.
7. The Renter is not allowed to rent the vehicle to a third party, sell the vehicle, and others. The Renter is fully responsible for any losses incurred due to this.
8. The Renter is not allowed to make any changes to the vehicle's structure (parts) without prior written consent from the Lessor.
9. The Lessor shall inform the Renter of any changes in rental fees and other matters as soon as possible, and any changes must be agreed upon and in writing by both parties.
10. If the Renter terminates this Agreement before the end of the rental period, the Renter shall pay 30% of the remaining rental fees for the rest of the rental period.
